Each soil attribute product is a collection of 5 depth slices. Each depth raster has an upper and lower uncertainty limit raster associated with it. The depths provided are 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm & 60-100cm, consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap (http://www.globalsoilmap.net). These products were developed using datasets held in the SALI (Soil and Land Information) database (DSITI & DNRM). The maps were made by using spatial modelling and digital soil mapping (DSM; McBratney et al., 2003) techniques to produce a fine-resolution 3-arc-second grid of soil attribute values and their uncertainties, across all of the Burdekin River Basin (130,000 km2)." ;

      dcterms:description "The soil attribute maps are generated using spatial modelling and digital soil mapping techniques. Soil inventory: Queensland soil site data originates from the SALI database, a compilation of various historical soil surveys. This database contains morphological and laboratory data for all the soil sites. Data Modelling: A raster stack of all covariatesâcomprising information on climate, gamma radiometrics, topography, soil mineralogy and vegetationâwas generated and the target variable (each soil property and depth) individually intersected with the covariate values to provide the calibration and validation data. All modelling was undertaken in âRâ (R Core Team 2014). Each map has been been created using a spatial regression model, based on the calibration and validation data. The covariates were used to describe the spatial trend, through a random-forest model (Liaw and Wiener, 2002). At each pixel, the spatial trend was computed, and then adjusted up or down by a kriging estimate of the residuals of the response variable. Pixel values represent the predicted value for a 100-m x 100-m area about the pixel centre. The uncertainty layers quantify the lower and upper bounds on the predicted value, which falls out as part of the prediction process when using spatial regression.
